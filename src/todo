TO DO:

- Look into cleaning up url routing in summoner match history
    - Think about what should be kept rendering and what should re-render based on url

- Display error message if rate limited (summoner match history)

- Matchup graph
    - Active champion indicator in champion select
    - Format active champion
        - Portrait/Splash for active champion
        - Highest win rates opponents
        - Lowest win rate opponents
        - Set champion as default or skeleton loader?
        - See more matchups?
            - reset num matchups on new active champion
        - Sort by elo
            - reset this on new active champion
